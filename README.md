# Life Inventory

A minimalist, mobile-first web app to inventory your life, separating **what you have** from **what you do**.

---

### The Problem It Solves

We often mix our physical inventory (things we own) with our tasks and rituals (things we do). A shopping list gets cluttered with reminders, and a to-do list might contain items we need to buy. This app solves that core confusion by creating a single, dedicated, and beautifully organized source of truth for **what you own**. It elevates a simple whiteboard list into a clear and infinitely expandable digital system.

### Core Features

-   **Hierarchical Organization:** Create categories and sub-categories to mirror your real-life organization (e.g., `Closet > Wardrobe > Shoes`).
-   **Dynamic Structure:** Add and delete new categories on the fly to build a system that is perfectly tailored to your life.
-   **Simple Item Management:** Quickly add, view, and delete items within any category. The interface is designed for speed and clarity.
-   **Persistent Storage:** Your inventory is securely saved to a Firebase backend, ensuring your data is safe and persistent across sessions. No need to create an account—it works anonymously and automatically.
-   **Elegant & Focused Design:** A clean, minimalist interface with a sophisticated color palette (`Warm Cream` & `Slate Gray`) designed to be calm, focused, and intuitive to use.

### Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend & Database:** Google Firebase (Firestore & Anonymous Authentication)
-   **Icons:** Lucide React
