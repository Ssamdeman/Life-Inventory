Here is the plan, distilled to its essence.

### 🏠 Title
**Life Inventory**

---

### 🧩 Problem It Solves
It separates **"what you have"** (your inventory) from **"what you do"** (your rituals), solving the core confusion of trying to manage both in one place. It elevates a physical whiteboard list into a clear, organized, and infinitely expandable digital system.

---

### 📱 Final Product (The MVP)
A mobile-first web application that serves as a dedicated digital inventory of your entire life. It is structured precisely around the categories and subcategories you have defined (e.g., Electronics, Closet, Kitchen), providing a single source of truth for *what you own*.

### 🔑 Key Features to Build
These are the foundational pillars required to bring the MVP to life:

* **Hierarchical Category System:** The core navigation. A multi-level structure that mirrors your whiteboard logic (e.g., `Closet > Wardrobe > Shoes`). This must be tangible and tappable.
* **Item Management:** The fundamental user action. The simple, elegant ability to **Add**, **View**, and **Delete** individual items within any given subcategory.
* **Persistent Data:** The system's memory. A database back-end that ensures every item a user adds is saved securely and persists between sessions.
* **Intuitive Mobile UI:** The tactile experience. A clean, tap-first interface designed for clarity, featuring obvious "back" navigation and a primary, unmistakable "add item" button.
