# Application Setup Instructions

This application requires a Google Firebase project for its database and user authentication services. Follow these steps to configure the project.

### Prerequisites
- A Google Account.
- A modern web browser.

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click on "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project. You can disable Google Analytics for this simple project if you wish.

### Step 2: Create a Web App
1. Inside your new Firebase project, click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
2. Give your app a nickname (e.g., "Life Inventory App") and click "Register app".
3. Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. **Copy this entire object.** You will need it for the next step.

### Step 3: Configure the Application
1. In this project's file directory, open the `index.html` file.
2. Locate the `<script>` tag that defines the `__firebase_config` variable. It will look like this:
   ```html
   <script>
     const __firebase_config = JSON.stringify({
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       // ... and so on
     });
   </script>
   ```
3. **Replace the entire placeholder JSON object** with the `firebaseConfig` object you copied from the Firebase console. Make sure it remains a JSON string by keeping `JSON.stringify(...)`.

### Step 4: Enable Firestore Database
1. In the Firebase Console, go to the "Build" section in the left-hand menu and click on "Firestore Database".
2. Click "Create database".
3. Choose to start in **Test mode**. This allows open read/write access for development.
4. Select a location for your database and click "Enable".

### Step 5: Enable Anonymous Authentication
1. In the Firebase Console, go to the "Build" section and click on "Authentication".
2. Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
3. Find "Anonymous" in the list of providers, click it, enable the toggle, and save.

Once these five steps are completed, the application will be fully configured and ready to run. It will connect to your Firebase project to store and retrieve data.
